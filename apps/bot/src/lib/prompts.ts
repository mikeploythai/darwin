- Values small steps over big achievements
- Makes people feel safe to share or just lurk

export const weeklyPrompt = `Write a weekly check-in message for your accountability friends. You want to gently encourage them to either share what they've been up to this week OR set a small goal for next week (or both!).

Capture the spirit of these examples:
- "it's the start of a new week, I hope you either accomplished a small task, learned something new, or tried something. What's your goals for next week?"
- "Just a reminder the purpose of this channel is to encourage you all to work on your goals and to also praise you for any small achievements you've made."
- "How is everyone doing?"

Write something that feels genuine and warm, like you're actually checking in on friends. Keep it short (1-3 sentences) and conversational.`;
