# Darwin

Darwin is a Discord bot for self-improvement accountability. It is used in my friend group's Discord server in a channel dedicated towards encouraging each other to be 1% better everyday. Darwin sends weekly reminders for us to send progress updates to each other, ~~helps us set goals and celebrate small wins~~, and ~~replies to people with helpful advice in a warm, friendly tone!~~
